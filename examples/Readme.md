## Examples section

The **examples** folder contains examples of implementation and usage of the `pgetopt` library, which greatly helps in learning this library. You can study each file in numerical order and, if needed, compile and run them.

### Steps of Learning

1. **One at a time :** Pay attention to the file numbers. Start with file 0. Try not to skip any files, as the topics of each file are connected like a chain.
  
2. **Documents :** Please read the documents. We've tried to explain things as clearly as possible within the limits of natural language. It's not our fault; the project manager is in a hurry!
  
3. **Compiling :** Try to compile the projects to see the output. Before compiling, try to guess what the output will be. To compile, follow the steps below. But you’re still free to choose! You can use any compiler you like—even Microsoft compilers!!! lol :)
  

`gcc <source.c> -o <binary> -L/usr/local/lib -lpgetopt -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib`

### What if we encounter bugs or errors?

If you encounter any issues anywhere in this project, please let us know in any language and style you prefer!

However, we would really appreciate it if you take a little time to explain the bugs and problems more clearly!
