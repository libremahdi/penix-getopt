=== Parsing Options for Non-Primary Classes

To parse options for other classes (other than `main`), you simply need to 
follow the while loop structure shown in the example above and place the pointer variable 
related to the aforementioned class in `pclass_loop_get_id`.

Of course, you must have previously created the class using `pclass_create` and other related 
functions, and initialized the palw associated with that class, which is exactly like the main class; 
we will see examples of this in future exercises.

while ( ( opt_id = pclass_loop_get_opt_id ( other_class, i ) ) != -1 ) {
    switch ( opt_id ) {
        case (1):
                // do something
                break;
        case (2):
                // do something
                break;
    }
    ++i;
}
