== Classes, Keys and Flags
In this chapter, we want to learn the first practical use of the library. 
We assume that you have studied <<book-introduction, Chapter Zero>>. As explained earlier, in order to implement 
`flags` and `keys`, we need to implement a `class`, which will later be introduced as main.

As we know, the first step is to create an _init_ for the library. 
Then the function `pclass_create` will handle the initialization of a class for us. 
Every class that is created must be freed. For this purpose, the function `pclass_free` is provided.
