=== What is the Pgetopt?
Every console tool used in Unix-like operating systems can interact with the user in various ways. 
In this context, there is a felt need for a comprehensive and principled standard that helps the 
user predict how to interact with all tools. To this end, and to increase the independence of 
Parabyte{nbsp}Systems, the pgetopt library has been designed by anticipating all the requirements 
of a console application.

{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}The structure and usage of the pgetopt library might seem 
slightly more complex than other similar tools, but it is important to understand 
that this complexity stems from the library’s high level of transparency. Furthermore, 
it enhances multithreading security, reusability, and the ability to combine functions 
to achieve even greater capabilities. For instance, using a simple technique, a user can 
utilize multiple 'Masters' sequentially within a single application—a feature that is not 
included by default. We will cover this trick in detail in the upcoming chapters.
