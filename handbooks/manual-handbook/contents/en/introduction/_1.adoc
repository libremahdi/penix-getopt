=== history
With the emergence of the Unix operating system and its early versions, 
at a time when computers were still massive and costly giants, 
programmers and developers of command-line tools processed input strings directly 
from the argv variable. No standard existed, and every programmer devised their own method. 
Beyond the lack of consistency among tools, a significant portion of the development time for 
each utility was wasted on the repetitive task of "argument parsing.

The methods devised by programmers were error-prone, repetitive, and unmaintainable. 
If a program had ten flags, ten different conditions had to be written,
and there was no way to validate or manage the arguments effectively.

{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}In 1979, with the release of Unix Version 7, a function named getopt was introduced. This function was included in the C standard library with a simple goal: 
to manage all Unix tool arguments in a unified manner.
Later, in the 1980s, the GNU project decided to create a more advanced version of getopt. 
This version supported not only single-character flags but also introduced long flags. 
While GNU could have taken a better path, their approach, compared to pgetopt, 
was arguably a failure!

Many of the ideas introduced and implemented during these decades suffered from similar flaws,
including unnecessary complexity, incomplete feature coverage (where much of the logic still had 
to be handled manually by the programmer!), and multithreading issues.

Due to these inherent flaws in argument parsing systems, 
Parabyte Systems decided to redesign an argument parser with a simple structure and advanced 
capabilities. Consequently, the initial version of pgetopt was created, but it soon met with 
failure. These successive setbacks continued until the third version; however, starting from 
version 4.0, pgetopt reached a stable and reliable architecture (and versions 5.0 and beyond may 
already be on the way!)

The Pgetopt library complies with the PENIX{nbsp}standard (Parabyte Precision Execution Native Interface for eXclusive systems)—a unified standard for all 
Parabyte{nbsp}Systems tools. For more information, visit https://penix.parabyte.com.
