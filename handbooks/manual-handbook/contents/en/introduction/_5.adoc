=== A Simple Practice

Next, we will look at the simplest program that can be written with _pgetopt_.
Pay attention to how the library is included. In the future, 
the _pgetopt library_ may undergo fundamental changes that could result in older software 
no longer being supported, in which case its major version will be incremented. We must 
therefore be careful to check the version of _pgetopt_ when including and using it.

[source,c]
----
#include <pgetopt-4.3/pgetopt.h>
int main ( int argc , char **argv )
{
	pinit *init;
	init = pinit_create ();
	pinit_free (init);
	return 0;
}
----

_Memory management_ in the C language is performed manually. 
Therefore, at the end, after creating init, *we must free it*. To free _pinit_, 
we use the function `pinit_free()`. The same principle applies to classes as well, 
which we will see in later chapters.

[source,c]
----
void pinit_free ( pinit **init );
